## My Goal

The objective of this project was to build an application containing all the basic and intermediate features of an android device. The application contains all the types of login/signup features including the OTP & Login with Gmail. The application uses the online Google's Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database for authenticating its users and storing the data for each user respectively. As the name of the app suggests, a user can perform a bunch of tasks just by using a single application. The tasks list includes Sensor ActionsðŸ“³, Media ActionsðŸŽµ, Calculator Actionsâž•âœ–, Camera ActionsðŸ“¸ðŸŽ¥ and much more. Hence providing a beautiful user interface depending on the platform i.e. Android.
